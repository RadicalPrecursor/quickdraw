## History

It was originally conceived in 2016 by Kate Kerr and Greg Sirokman, and implemented in the classroom setting using handmade cards and whiteboards.

An original attempt was made to implement this project starting in October 2021, that also doubled as a very early and messy exercise in learning JavaScript and React.  The old repo for that is [here.](https://github.com/RadicalPrecursor/QuickDraw-browser)
